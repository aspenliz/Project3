# Project3

To Begin, we selected our topic by finding data that relates to leading causes of death in the United States and merging it into one csv file.

the index.html file includes Leaflet Javascript code, Leaflet CSS and openlayers js library etc.

This project delivers three uniue visualizations regarding our topic of "Top 10 diseases that cause deaths in the United States". 
(interactive map, bar and line graph)

The project conforms to the following designs:
Leaflet and Plotly charts built from data gathered through web scraping.
A dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data.

Tools used in this project: 
- JavaScript and libraries like Leaflet and Plotly;
- Google Chrome DevTools;
- HTML;
- Python Flask;
- SQL;
- Bootstrap.


The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels.

Finally, created a web application, featuring maps, plots, and a dropdown menu.
